## Implementing a FEM solver:

The fem solver resides in a subfolder of the same name in the femsolver folder found at:
`src/Mod/Fem/femsolver/`  
In our case the full directory is:  
`src/Mod/Fem/femsolver/mofem`  
There, one needs three scripts which take care of the FEM implementation:  
1. [solver.py](solver.py.md)  
2. [tasks.py](tasks.py.md)  
3. [wrtier.py](writer.py.md)  

Other implementation details are given here:  
+ [GUI](GUI.md)
