# Preferences Page
A new .ui file is needed which can be made using QT plus the free cad plugin which can be build from the wiki instructions.

In the preference page the ui element's parameters need to be set, so it can be used by the DlgFem\<Name>.cpp script. Each element needs a save and load statement to be usable.



Something needs to be added to AppFemGui.cpp
